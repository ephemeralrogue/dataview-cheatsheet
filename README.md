# Summary

This cheatsheet provides a handy reference guide for writing queries using **Dataview Query Language**Â (**DQL**) in the [dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin for [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) note-taking app.

# How this repository came about

As I found myself frequently querying data within Obsidian, I created this cheatsheet to have quick access to the most common queries I use regularly. By adding this cheatsheet locally in Obsidian, I no longer need to leave Obsidian app and search the query syntax online.

While this cheatsheet is primarily for my own use, I'm sharing it here in case others find it useful as well. I would suggest you copy this readme and paste it in your Obsidian vault so you can search it locally just like I do.

# Obsidian Dataview Cheatsheet

Welcome to the **Obsidian Dataview Cheatsheet** repository. This cheatsheet provides a handy reference guide for writing powerful queries using the dataview plugin in Obsidian.

# How this repository came about

As I found myself frequently querying data within Obsidian, I created this cheatsheet to have quick access to the most common and powerful queries I use regularly. By having this cheatsheet locally in Obsidian, I no longer need to search online every time I want to perform a specific query.

While this cheatsheet is primarily for my own use, I'm sharing it here in case others find it useful as well. Feel free to explore and utilise it to enhance your Obsidian experience. I would suggest you copy this readme and paste it in your Obsidian vault so you can query it locally just like I do.
